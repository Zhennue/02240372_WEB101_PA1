This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Notes on Styling


## CSS Modules:

## Tailwind CSS: 
Used for utility-first styling across components and pages.

## Global Styles: 
Defined in globals.css for consistent styling.

# Notes on Functionality
## Routing:
pages/ directory uses traditional Next.js routing.
app/ directory uses the new app directory structure for layouts and pages.

## Authentication: Implemented using NextAuth in [...nextauth].js.

## State Management: 
MyContext.js provides a global state using React Context.


# Development Notes
Run the development server using npm run dev.
Use npm run build to create a production build.
Use npm run lint to check for linting issues.
